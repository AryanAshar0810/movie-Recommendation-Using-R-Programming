# Movie-Recommendation-Using-R-Programming

A recommendation system provides suggestions to the users through a filtering process that is based on user 
preferences and browsing history. The information about the user is taken as an input. The information is 
taken from the input that is in the form of browsing data. There are two types of recommendation systems â€“
Content-Based Recommendation System and Collaborative Filtering Recommendation. In this project of 
recommendation system in R, we will work on a collaborative filtering recommendation system and more 
specifically, ITEM based collaborative recommendation system.
